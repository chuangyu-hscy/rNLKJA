### Hello there (à¸…'Ï‰'à¸…) This is Rin Huang

#### I am a Data Science student currently study in the [University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/) ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º from China ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³

I'm interesting in data science and passionate in data.

This repository is my personal react-app, I want to build this webpage as my personal CV page/blog page, I don't know how long this will take but I will try my best!

#### About the usage

To update your own profile information. Please make sure that you copy this repository and install all required packages. To avoid package conflicts, please avoid use `npm audit fix` feature.

```bash
# Install required react packages
yarn install

# Install required npm packages
npm i
```

After install these libraries, you could modify the information under the directory `./src/components`.

There are five components you could edit:

- Brief Information: short introduction about yourself
- More profile
  - Add more complex description about
  - Programming skills: add your relevant skills, you could edit these in `./src/components/SkillIcons.tsx`
  - Education Backgrounds: edit this file: `./src/components/EducationTimeline.tsx`
  - Past involved Projects: `./src/components/ProjectList.tsx`
  - Certificates: `./src/components/Certificates.tsx`

If you want to add some working experience, you could also create your own components and call it in `./src/profile/Profile.tsx`.

As the custom css, please edit `./src/profile/Styles/Profile.css`, you may notice that I do add scss as part of npm dependencies, you could remove this if you don't want any scss/sass support for pure css experience.

Btw, you may also want to edit page title in `index.html`, or you could use `` useEffect(() => {document.title={`${YOUR_CUSTOM_TITLE}`}}) `` to change it.

In the end, upload your own `favicon.ico` to replace the original one under path `./public/favicon.ico`, otherwise you will see my photo on browser tag, which is, well, if you are happy to keep it.

#### Deployment your website

You could deploy this application on various platforms like heroku, aws, google, etc. Here I will suggest you deploy this on github pages since this is a light website and most importantly, it's free and convenience!

Before deploy your website, the first thing is create a github repository with your prefer repo name.

Second, you need to make sure `gh-pages` is installed correctly, if not, please install using command `npm install gh-pages --save-dev` or `npm install gh-pages -g` to install globally.

After that, you need to modify the package.json file.

1. You need to change the `"homepage"` attribute to your github repository with the format`https://<github username>.github.io/<repo name>`, for example: `https://chuangyu-hscy.github.io/rNLKJA`.
2. Change the `"name"` attribute which is below `"homepage"`, because this is your own webpage, change it with your prefer name! Notice there is no space allow in `"name"` otherwise it will cause a compile error.
3. Check both `"predeploy"` and `"deploy"` command exist in `"script"` attribute, if not you need to add the following lines: `"predeploy": "npm run build","deploy": "gh-pages -d build"` in `"script"` attribute.
4. It is time to deploy your react webpage! Run `npm run deploy` and you will receive a success output!
5. Go to your repository, go to setting and click pages tag on the left navigation column. Once you in the right page, you should see the webpage link and good to go!

Some potential issues:

- If you add your custom domain, you need to change `"homepage"` attribute the same as the custom domain, otherwise you will have a blank page.
- After deploy, please wait for 5 mins to visit your webpage, if you still receive a 404 error after 5-10 mins, you may need to check the above steps again or looking for help via stack overflow or google.

If you want some reading guides for `gh-pages` deployment, please visit this article written by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/deploy-a-react-app-to-github-pages/).
