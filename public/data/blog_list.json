    "brief": "As 2023 unfolds, I've embarked on a transformative journey with the start of my master's degree, a period of self-discovery and contemplation about my future identity and aspirations. Although faced with confusion and without significant achievements initially, a turning point came with my internship at HEX, where I realized the commonality of shared ideas and the importance of making them a reality. This realization prompted me to rebuild my profile website and set concrete goals for 2024, aiming to embrace freelance work, document my life through blogs, vlogs, and podcasts, and continually explore new ventures. This blog marks the beginning of an ambitious journey, hoping to inspire others to pursue their dreams in the coming year."
